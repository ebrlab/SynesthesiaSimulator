"# SynesthesiaSimulator" 

This project is an attempt at simulating and replicating the neorological sensory condition Synaesthesia using Unity 5 and an Oculus Rift.  It was completed as part of a Dissertation in Computer Science at the University of Reading, in 2016.  This proof of concept is designed to be open-source and modular, with future expandability being a key feature.  For more information, see the attached report (pending).
